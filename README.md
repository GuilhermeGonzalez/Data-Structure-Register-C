# Data-Structure-Register-C
:tada: A data structure has been put in place for a Double Linked List Ordered by Countries, where it has a pointer that points to a Simply Linked List of Medicines, where this Drug List also points to a Simply Linked List of Users who use this medication.
Note: Countries and Medicines are not repeated in the database, but users are, as the purchase history of this User medicine (dt_ultmC) would be maintained.
